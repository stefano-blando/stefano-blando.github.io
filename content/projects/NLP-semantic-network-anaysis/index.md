Development of a comprehensive methodology for **extracting knowledge from unstructured text** by bridging statistical analysis with network science. Applied to a case study of *The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes*, this project transforms raw textual data into navigable semantic maps.

**Technical Stack:**
* **Text Representation:** Vector Space Model utilizing **TF-IDF** weighting to capture term importance and filter stop-words.
* **Dimensionality Reduction:** Applied **Correspondence Analysis (CA)** to identify associations between terms and documents in a lower-dimensional factor map.
* **Clustering & Network Analysis:** Utilized **K-Means** for semantic grouping and the **Louvain algorithm** for detecting modular communities within the keyword co-occurrence network.
* **Visualization:** Integration with **Gephi** and R libraries (factoextra, igraph) to visualize the topological structure of semantic relationships.
