  Agent-based models (ABMs) are increasingly used to study complex economic phenomena such as
  endogenous growth, but their analysis typically relies on ad-hoc Monte Carlo exercises without
  formal statistical guarantees. We show how statistical model checking (SMC), and in particular
  MultiVeStA, can automate and enrich the analysis of a seminal ABM: the Island Model of Fagiolo and
  Dosi, which captures the exploration-exploitation trade-off in technological search. We reproduce
  key stylized facts from the original model with formal confidence intervals, confirm the
  optimality of moderate exploration rates, and perform a counterfactual sensitivity analysis across
  returns to scale, skill transfer, and knowledge locality. Using MultiVeStA's built-in Welch's
  t-test, 6 out of 7 pairwise parameter comparisons yield statistically different growth
  trajectories, while the exception reveals a saturation effect in knowledge locality. Our results
  demonstrate that SMC offers a principled, reproducible methodology for the quantitative analysis
  of agent-based economic models.
summary: >-
  Presented at MARS @ ETAPS 2026, this paper uses MultiVeStA to give the Island Model a more
  rigorous and reproducible statistical analysis.
